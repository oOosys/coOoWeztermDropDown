# coOoWeztermDropDown
Shell script for toggling visibility of any Linux Mint 21.2 Xfce Window ( e.g. wezterm Terminal )

Works for me on Linux Mint 21.2 Xfce simulating Guake-like Dropdown behavior toggling the visibility of the wezterm Terminal Window I prefer to trigger with F9 in order to avoid conflits with Guake on F12. 
Adapt it to your purposes. I assume that it provides through the style of code and the comments all what is needed to make it work including hiding/showing the Window no matter the current Workspace.

I am editing my files using Ubuntu PROPORTIONAL font and TABs giving me a perfect column elighned layout looking really weird while viewing using a monospaced font. Using other fonts than Ubuntu will destroy the elighnment as it is based on the proprtion of the Space character width in relation to other characters in the font and it seems that each font designer incorporates into the font own concept related to character widths. In other words Ubuntu Regular (proportional version) seems to be the only to me known font which guarantees the right column alighnemt. 

P.S. I reject to support the idea that there is a necessity of Copyright or Licence Conditions/Terms. I have made it public, so use it ... and remember that it's YOUR reponsibility to care about the outcome if you do. If this works on any other system it's shure nice, but I limit myself to care only about this one mentioned I am using myself.
